## Running code

To run my code first run bash compile.sh in the command line

Next there are two options...

Option 1 - run using a file
if you want to run code using a file provided in the resources folder please use java -cp bin src/SortingDriver resources/*insert file name here*

Option 2 - randomly generate a list
if you want the program to randomly generate a list of length you choose then run it using  java -cp bin src/SortingDriver
